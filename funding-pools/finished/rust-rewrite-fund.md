## Description
Hello Kaspers! I am glad to announce that Kaspa Rust fund wallet has been officially established!

Many thanks to @The AllFather for the first ever donation to this address in the amount of 10M Kas!

If you want you can contact @avidan who keeps track of the donations, and provide him with the following information: your Discord or Telegram name + transaction id + return address (must be the sending address) for possible refund. The up to date list of donations (both planned and completed), managed by @avidan, can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q1_aCQy3Qvu5-rwoZ3THQhpWL9T5QUPf_SlVVF_jZRg/edit?usp=sharing 

Also in the near future a certain number of coins will be transferred to two other Rust fund wallet addresses from the public dev fund:

- to the address `kaspa:prwh2umnj7naewqkqq7qw87smyf4x0ehtk7m3j7x33hh67agw76z6zkwvtz2s` - coins that are collected to the pub fund's temporary address for early donors (see temporary pub fund address balance: https://katnip.cbytensky.org/addr/kaspa:pp08y9g9epsp69t29uvm3d6hmqz9zmgzandt6j6y8fazj02hx8756jmumpgpa);
- to the address `kaspa:przn2keqczhwc2c3g5sycknw9lp84cjgksxmfk6z8kcg83lnpczxsmg6evzuv` - another 20M Kas from the public fund, the transfer of which was approved by the recent vote (⁠votes⁠).

We hope that all members of the Kaspa community will take part in filling up this fund as much as it is comfortable to them. Let's get Kaspa to the moon!
