## Description
Hello Kaspers!

Welcome to the second community funding pool!

The proposal behind this pool is to get $KAS listed on the crypto exchange hoo.com.

Hoo.com is a huge asian crypto exchange with a current daily volume of around 4 billion dollars (according to CMC and Coingecko, however we know this includes AMM activities etc.).

There are currently around 400+ tokens listed on their exchange and they have a really huge user base.

This listing could bring the necessary awareness to get into listing considerations of high tier exchanges and could also be a catalyst for reaching a big audience as hoo.com promised to launch several marketing activities.


We got the following offer:

-20 Million KAS for a listing on their platform

-They told us that 70% would be used for AMM and marketing activities and 30% can be seen as listing and maintenance fees


As already mentioned the goal for this pool has been set at 20 Million KAS.

The duration for this pool is 3 weeks (Until June 30th, 8pm CET). If we miss the necessary cap, everyone would get refunded.

Supported Currencies: $KAS only

Thank you very much for your support! üôè

### Updates
#### Update 1
First of all:
Thanks for every single contribution so far! You are awesome!

In the moment of writing this update we've reached an amount of 2.4 million KAS in the funding wallet.

Due to the help of our great chinese community (Big thanks to @AMAO for this initiative) we received another

7.8 million KAS, which means we received the amazing amount of 10.2 million KAS so far.

And that's not all: A single donator contacted us and plans to put another few millions to the funding pool today.
The exact amount of this donation will be announced later today.

In other words: I'm happy to announce that we'll definitely reach the cap of 20m this week.

That's why we decided to close this pool within the next 72 hours! So if you want to support this initiative please do so within the next
3 days.

Again: A big thanks to all of you! You are amazing!

#### Update 2
Just another quick update as there were some misunderstandings in communication during a discussion between @AMAO and me.

But before going into detail let me share the latest numbers with you:

The funding pool reached 10.5M, so more than 50% got filled.

These 10.5M includes the funds from our chinese community (Around 8M, thanks to all of you guys!)


So what was the misunderstanding about?

The mentioned donator which wanted to add several million KAS to the pool was @AMAO. At least we thought so.

While discussing his successful fund raising in the chinese community it looked like he plans to add another 8M from his own funds, but he was talking about the funds from the

chinese community and not about his own funds. It was not only me who got it wrong but also several other people from the team.

It was just a misunderstanding and not an intentionally caused problem.


The good thing is that @AMAO talked to Hoo.com recently and achieved an agreement on a compromise with them. As initially mentioned they planned to use 70% of the funds for marketing and
30% to cover integration and maintenance costs.

As there are currently more than 10.5M KAS in the pool, the integration and maintenance costs can be covered. Hoo.com agreed on the compromise that in case we don't hit the 20m cap, they'll list KAS anyway
and adjust the marketing efforts according to the final amount.

So we keep the 72h deadline and would be happy about every additional donation to get as much awareness as possible by increasing the marketing fund as much as possible.


Again: Thank you very much for every single contribution so far and sorry for the confusion. We'll keep you posted! 

#### Update 3
Hello Kaspers!

I'm happy to announce the final funding pool amount of 12 Million KAS.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this pool. Donating funds in such a difficult market situation is not easy and this definitely shows the strength of this community.

Hoo.com is currently scheduling the integration process and will get back to us shortly. We'll let you

know once the funds have been sent out and of course we'll keep you posted about the integration process in the funding-pools-discussion channel.

The listing will be announced through all official channels.

#### Update 4

Hello Kaspers!
As already mentioned a few days ago, we stepped down from a deal with hoo.com due to their liquidity issues and some shady behaviour. After that, the chinese community decided to spend their 10m funding on the Rust rewrite proposal instead which is really great and much appreciated by the team.

There are now around 2.7m KAS left in the hoo.com pool. As mentioned in the initial hoo.com proposal post, we will offer a refund opportunity.

If you were a donator and want to request a refund, please send a mail to freshman@kaspa.org until July 20th, 6pm UTC and provide all the necessary information to prove that the donation was sent by you (source address, TX-ID, a link to the transaction, optional: screenshot).

If you don't want to request a refund and want to support the rust proposal instead, there is no need to do anything. The remaining funds will be sent to the rust proposal wallet after the refund period is over.

Thanks again for your great support!
