## Description
Welcome to the next community funding pool!

The proposal behind this pool is to provide Kaspa native mobile wallet implementation in accordance with the terms of the recently completed vote here:  ⁠votes⁠

As it is said in the above vote terms, the goal for current pool has been set at min 5.5 Million and max 6.5 Million KAS.

The duration for this pool is until September 1st, 2022.

Supported Currencies: $KAS, USDTs BEP-20 (BNB) and TRC-20 (Tron). For the 1st one, the new address has been created at the existing Kaspa pub fund with 2/4 multisig wallet managed by the community @Treasurers. For the latter 2 the special accounts on both TxBit and Exbitron has been created, these accounts are managed by @Tim and @jwj. 

If we miss the 5.5M goal, all funds gathered by September the 1st will be held at the fund for a possible agreement terms review etc. If we reach 5.5M but miss the 6.6M goal, we declare we don't need Push Notification and all what's gathered above 5.5M is held onto pub fund for a future community needs. At 6.5M+ we declare we need Push Notifications option as well and what's gathered above 6.5M is held onto pub fund for the future needs as well.

### Updates

#### Update 1
The mobile wallet funding pool has been closed. As the minimum threshold of 5.5M is not reached, we're going to start negotiations with the wallet developer anew. The results will be announced here in the #funding-pools channel.

#### Update 2
I have nice news about the mobile wallet.
We have reached the agreement with the mobile wallet developer and decreased the amount: 1.7M for each of the predefined milestones and 0.6M for push notifications, totaling it 4M Kaspa. The leftovers from the mobile wallet fund will be transferred to the ongoing "marketmaker for the exchange" fund collection.
