## Description
Meanwhile I want also to remind you folks that @Chris Hopium is making the first ever animated Kaspa movie for us and it would be very nice of you to tip him for his efforts, so to help him bear the 2k$ of expenses he's taking for making this movie.

He's already got a short teaser, take a look https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/996624983075848212/1022147645726281779/e480a726-644c-45cb-87ef-43ab035b5723.MP4
