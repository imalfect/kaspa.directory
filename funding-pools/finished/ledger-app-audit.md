## Description
**This funding pool has been completed in an astonishing 30 minutes! This shows the generosity of the Kaspa community and the importance of the Ledger audit. (see screenshot at the end)**
Thanks to @Bubblegum Lightning's efforts (see discussion and pinned post in the Ledger Security Audit Proposal discord channel), we have finally received a price tag from Kudelski Security and can begin raising funds for the long-awaited audit of the Ledger application, which will be the final step necessary for Ledger to add full support for Kaspa. Ledger is literally a stone's throw away! üôÇ

Our permanent ‚ÄúCFO‚Äù @Wolfie is responsible for carrying out financial transactions; he will convert collected Kaspa into dollars as received and whenever possible, accumulate all funds on his own and make the final payment. The collection is going to be held in Kaspa and different USDTs.
