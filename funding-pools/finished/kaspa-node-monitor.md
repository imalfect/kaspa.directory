## Description
A pool for Kaspa node monitor implementation proposed by @imalfect. Seems like the community is already interested enough in this project so the pool launches without a prior vote.

Objective: a fullstack project, which will display all information about the node on the website such as: version, uptime, peers, current block, ledger size, sync status, load and memory usage etc. Opensource solution.

Grant request: 200k Kas.

ETA: 2 weeks after the funding pool is collected.

Reward release terms: 50% upon the MVP, and the remaining 50% on the Final release.
