## Description
Hello Kaspians! As you may know, the integration of Kaspa into the Ledger hardware wallet requires that Kaspa provide a wallet application, which will be the basis for further integration.

Members of the community have negotiated with several firms specializing in the development of such applications, and the price tag announced by them was in the range of 30-50k USD, which is quite a significant amount for the community.

With the thought of such a large expense in mind - we decided to evaluate whether we can create such an application with the help of existing contributors.

Here I pass the word to @Wolfie:
> We have good news!
Elichai (@elichai2), Ori (@someone235), and myself had a zoom with Ledger this morning December 1st 2022. As it turns out, the Kaspa Application for Ledger can be done in-house by the 2 Experts I had with me on the call. However, it is still a task and we arrived at a figure of 1,000,000 $KAS as a fund-raise goal to show our gratitude for taking on yet another coding task in the midst of all the other groundbreaking and complex challenges already at hand. There are already several community members who are also Ledger enthusiasts and look forward to contributing in an effort to safeguard their $KAS holdings on the industry standard hardware wallet platform.

So I hereby announce another fund collection round for the development of an app for Ledger, in the amount of 1M Kaspa.
Please note - if you are extra happy and grateful to these guys for helping to secure YOUR $KAS - please keep going after we reach one million coins - any overflow will be their tip \ bonus round !!
