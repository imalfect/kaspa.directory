## Description
Bitpanda is a CeFi Platform, a multi-asset brokerage and exchange with fully backed user assets. They offer features such as a savings plan and a debit card from which you can spend your cryptocurrency, precious metals, and stocks with the tap of a card. Through negotiations, Kaspa has been presented with a very attractive proposal **to appear on their SpotLight Program** in exchange for co-marketing & sponsoring a $KAS giveaway for their subscribed users. This will help attract new users to Bitpanda and allow dedicated Bitpanda subscribers to experience Kaspa for the first time!

The goal is to raise **$5000 USD value in KAS** to cover co-marketing costs. It's crucial to understand that **this is not a listing fee** paid to BitPanda, but an **amount that will be airdropped to Bitpanda users**.

Once the contributions have been secured, the $KAS will be used to airdrop at Bitpanda's discretion.

This listing will fortify Kaspa's European stronghold and get us one step closer to our mission of inclusivity and accessibility. Thanks for your support and your contributions!
