## Description
**This pool didn't reach its goal, but the funds were still distributed to the translators.**

**In short**: this fund is aimed to reward the efforts of Ambassadors and Translators. See the link above and maybe have a journey through related links and discussions to get the full view of the topic in case you're not sure what's the talk about.

Let's encourage people's dedication to Kaspa and thank them, our active community members, for the opportunity to use wallets in our native languages!
