## Description
Kaspa has a great opportunity to be listed on a high-tier exchange (Top 20)! Through negotiations we were presented a very attractive proposal with a listing fee of just $50K USDT. This funding pool is to raise that $50K USDT Listing fee.  The exchange cannot be named at this time due to a legally binding non-disclosure agreement.

In addition to this pool, a temporary liquidity fund (50k USDT + 50k$ worth of KAS) is needed to get listed. The duration is one month and starts around the listing date. The funds will be returned by the exchange after the month has ended. If you are willing to help and want to provide liquidity please reach out to one of the admins or send an email to w@kaspa.org . Full details shall be provided upon serious inquiry.  

**The exchange was MEXC**

#### Updates

In case you missed it - crowdfunding of the high-tier exchange listing fee is complete! The $50k $USDT is already in the custody of the exchange - here's that transaction: https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe7a640aa96727912880ec91bc646d074778fca9104963635e4d40727586ed142 .

We are also happy to announce we negotiated a reduction in the refundable liquidity needed--from $100K Total ($50K + $50K), to only a total of $50K!

Before the actual listing can take place there are a few more steps to go. According to the agreement with the exchange, KASPA must hire a third-party professional market making service for the first month. We interviewed and received quotes from a handful of MMs and have selected to partner with Skynet: https://skynettrading.com/

The non-refundable cost for 1 month market making is 5000$ to be paid in a stable coin.

To cover the fee we are opening up another 5000$ funding pool for USDT, USDC, or BUSD. If you want to participate in this pool and support the listing process, you can send USDT (ETH/BEP20), USDC (ETH/BEP20), or BUSD

Once we raise the $5000 fund the last step will be the refundable liquidity provisions as we mentioned in the first announcement. Thanks to all that have already inquired with us for providing this initial trading liquidity, if more are interested due to the reduction in the funds necessary, please reach out to us at freshman@kaspa.org
