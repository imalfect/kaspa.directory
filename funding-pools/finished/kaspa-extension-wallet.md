## Description

**In short**: this fund is aimed to back up creation of a browser extension wallet for Kaspa (Metamask-like) supporting Firefox and Chromium-based browsers. It should implement all the basic wallet functionality as well as contact book, user settings, website-to-wallet communication API and Merchant Mode, see vote above for details.

People keep asking "how can I buy Kaspa to Metamask", so let's create the wallet that's destined to eventually replace Metamask, especially after Kaspa smart contracts are implemented!
