## Description
As per the vote, this pool is for kaspa to get integrated on cryptocurrency checkout (see below)

We have received word from the maintainer of cryptocurrency checkout (https://cryptocurrencycheckout.com/) who was contacted by one of our community members a while ago. They have offered to integrate kaspa into their payment gateway. this will lead to kaspa being an easily implementable payment option, for merchants, on major e-commerce sites (as well as donation option for many social medias) via their gateway plugins. Direct use cases for kaspa itself could potentially be a donation link on kaspa.org, kaspa associated social media, and perhaps eventually a kaspa merch shop, to gather devfund funds.

the maintainer has asked for $800 to integrate kaspa as a flat fee this will be a one-time flat fee for integration, and not subscription based, as is often the standard for cryptocurrency payment gateways. Which imo is a fair price.
