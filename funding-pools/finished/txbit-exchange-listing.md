## Description
Hello Kaspers!

Welcome to the first community funding pool!

The proposal behind this pool is to get $KAS listed on the crypto exchange txbit.io.

Txbit.io is fully integrated on the most important crypto listing pages such as Coinmarketcap, Coingecko and the portfolio tracking app FTX (former Blockfolio).

A listing on Txbit would bring us the opportunity to get listed on these crypto pages as well. It would also increase the chances to get listed on other exchanges.

As there is no other exchange listing yet, a listing on txbit.io would also provide a secured environment for buying/selling activities.

We got the following offer:

-2000$ to be paid in a stablecoin.

-They told us that Kaspa could be listed within two weeks after the payment has been made. (Please keep in mind that this is just an estimation. There could always be some unforeseen issues)

The goal for this pool has been set at 2100$ to cover all potencial fees. If there is some money from the additional 100$ left, we would use it to help filling another community funding pool in the future.

The duration for this pool is 2 weeks (Until April 10th, 8pm CET). If we miss the necessary cap, everyone would get refunded.

Supported Currencies: BUSD (BEP20) or USDT (BEP20) only

Thank you very much for your support!
