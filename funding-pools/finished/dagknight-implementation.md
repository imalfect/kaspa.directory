Everybody is welcome to participate! üôÇ

### A brief overview of whys and whats:

- What will it give Kaspa?

DAGKnight (DK) is a new consensus protocol that achieves responsiveness - a WORLD FIRST - it reacts to the actual network delay, unlike every other coin including our current GHOSTDAG protocol). Incredibly, it retains a 50%-byzantine tolerance, so it is faster and more secure than GHOSTDAG.

In a nutshell (thanks @jwj  for the wording) DAGKnight will make Kaspa:

1) require less confirmations to be provably secure;

2) intrinsically scale as internet speeds increase, basically as the internet gets faster over the next decades with more fiber optic cables etc, Kaspa will scale with this, without any hard fork interventions.

This will make our coin literally the Ultimate L1 PoW coin in existence.

### Why 70M?

It is unreasonable to expect a senior software engineer\contributor to work a short term horizon for the same compensation they would receive in a permanent position which would include benefits etc.

Consider we are funding 2 of the most incredibly gifted and professional crypto minds of the current decade, already intimately versed and fluent with all of the intricate components of Kaspa - working nearly one year full time, implementing the paramount version of the consensus protocol. Normally funding this from a VC would require millions of USD. Can you feel how extremely bullish it is that they are asking to be paid in $KAS, not $BTC, not $USDC !?!?

### How much to donate?

The requested amount is ~0.5% of the total (current) supply. Unfortunately, not everyone will donate for many reasons, the most common would be that survival instinct we have all come to know of as greed üòâ

Its counter-intuitive to get more by giving some away ‚Äì just ask any squirrel who is out collecting nuts.

But in the case of Kaspa, we are fortunate that the nuts don‚Äôt stay nuts ‚Äì thanks to software, they can change.

Imagine you have 50 regular cars. You have an opportunity to give one car away, which will make the 49 you have left turn into race cars! Now who would say no to that!?!?

You actually may be able to tell your grandchildren that ‚Äúyou helped bring the crypto standard to life that‚Äôs still in use today !!‚Äù

### Updates

#### Update 1
If the goal is not reached, we will most likely return, at the request of those who wish, their donations to the original addresses where the donations came from, and with regards to the unclaimed part (after a certain period has passed during which a return can be requested) we will vote on what to spend it on.

#### Update 2
To make it clear, a cite from Yonatan's Medium post (https://hashdag.medium.com/kaspa-where-to-part-iii-72ddd0bbe6ae, section 4):
The community accepting the grant is by no means a necessary condition for having DK implemented on Kaspa ‚Äî Sutton and I will attempt at implementing it regardless, since, again, there exists already a non-materialistic incentive for us to do so. However, since we are not saints, this will be done on our spare time with non-committal or unspecified timeline.

P.S. I'd like to draw a special attention to the fact that if we want to collect 0.5% of the current supply, each one of Kaspa holders should donate 0.5% of what they currently have, but since not everyone will donate, each donor is kindly asked to consider donating 1% to 2% of his possessions (speaking of which I can PM my personal donation details to anyone by request).
#### Update 3

To say that what's happened today is impressive means say nothing. This could have been a Christmas miracle if it had not been the result of the absolutely amazing generosity of our community members.

It is with great joy that I announce that the DagKnight Implementation financing fund of 70 million Kas has been fully raised today, December 30, 2022, 12 days (!) after the announcement of its launch. Here it is: https://explorer.kaspa.org/addresses/kaspa:ppk66xua7nmq8elv3eglfet0xxcfuks835xdgsm5jlymjhazyu6h5ac62l4ey

I don‚Äôt even know if any other crypto community can compare with ours.

Thank you so much to all the donors, you are the best thing that could have happened to Kaspa: you, the People.
