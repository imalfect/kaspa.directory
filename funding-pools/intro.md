# Intro

## What are funding pools?
Funding pools in Kaspa are a way for the community to fund projects that they want to see developed.
Every community member with a project idea and knowledge how to do it can request the creation of the funding pool in order to collect funds necessary to develop the project.
The funds are collected in a multisig address, managed by the treasurers (more about treasurers in the community section).
The funds are released to the project owner in a series of payments, based on the milestones that the project owner has defined.

## How to request the creation of the funding pool?
Usually, in order to create a funding pool, you should join [Kaspa's discord](https://discord.gg/kaspa), visit the
#votes-and-funding-discussions channel, and post your proposal there. If the idea gains enough interest, a vote in the #votes channel is made.
Once the vote passes, the funding pool is created and the community can donate to it.

## What if the funding pool doesn't reach its goal?
In case the requested amount is not collected by that date, all funds gathered are to be held at the pub fund for a possible agreement terms review or repurposing to another goal.
