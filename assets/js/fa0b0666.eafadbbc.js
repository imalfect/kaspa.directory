I already decided to give 2nd also 1Eth when its submitted closely enough ... well and the two are obviously independent, cause one is in rust and the other in node.js\n\nI'm very happy that it worked out so quickly and even happier that there are two different entries that both look great to me - it's always good to have a little choice. Once I have ensured that I can connect to both with at least 2-3 mining rigs and have successfully created testnet blocks with them I will post the links to the repos. I think it's cool that it worked out!\n\nAs far as I can see the operation of both is also very easy. One builds with cargo, the other you will probably be able to install with npm. To build it, each are one-liners and also the usage is limited to the desired node address, stratum port and wallet address to be mined to. Much low-threshold it almost can not be, that should be good for all...```\n")))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
